90#VERS#COMMENT##: p. 531 is missing; one verse missing on p. 407;
  occasionally, individual hemistichs were not separated by %~% (see the poems on pp. 222, 373, 398, 428, 430, 523, 524). 
  The reason is that, in such cases, the boundary between the two hemistichs corresponds to a consonant with tashdīd 
  (such as yaladh %~% dhu, yuḥak %~% kimu, him %~% mati, etc.), which cannot be split.
  In such cases, %~% has been inserted as -%~%- according to the respective metre, with
  one of the doubled consonants on each side of -%~%- (e.g., yaladh-%~%-dhu, yuḥak-%~%-kimu, etc.);
  on p. 524, %~% has been added by the annotator according to the metre.
