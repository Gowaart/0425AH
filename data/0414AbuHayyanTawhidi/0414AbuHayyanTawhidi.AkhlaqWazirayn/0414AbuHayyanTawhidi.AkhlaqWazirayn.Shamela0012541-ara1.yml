90#VERS#COMMENT##: Some page numbers are missing, but the text seems complete. 
    Missing page numbers are the same pages of which the images are missing
    in the pdf on archive.org (pp. 1, 4-5, 8-9)!
    The text of page 531 was missing; PV added it. All other pages seem present.
    The edition does not contain explicit subdivisions; 
    PV has added (between square brackets) the subdivisions mentioned by Behzadi
    (Lale Behzadi, "Authorial Guidance: Abū Ḥayyān al-Tawḥīdī's Closing Remarks",
